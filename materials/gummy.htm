<b>ABSTRACT</b>
</p><p>
Potential threats caused by something like real fingers, which are called
fake or artificial fingers, should be crucial for authentication based on
fingerprint systems. Security evaluation against attacks using such artificial
fingers has been rarely disclosed. Only in patent literature, measures, such
as "live and well" detection, against fake fingers have been proposed. However,
the providers of fingerprint systems usually do not mention whether or not
these measures are actually implmented in emerging fingerprint systems for
PCs or smart cards or portable terminals, which are expected to enhance the
grade of personal authentication necessary for digital transactions. As
researchers who are pursuing secure systems, we would like to discuss attacks
using artificial fingers and conduct experimental research to clarify the
reality. This paper reports that gummy fingers, namely artificial fingers
that are easily made of cheap and readily available gelatin, were accepted
by extremely high rates by particular fingerprint devices with optical or
capacitive sensors. We have used the molds, which we made by pressing our
live fingers against them or by processing fingerprint images from prints
on glass surfaces, etc. We describe how to make the molds, and then show
that the gummy fingers, which are made with these molds, can fool the fingerprint
devices.

<b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>
</p><p>
Biometrics is utilized in individual authentication techniques which identify
individuals, i.e., living bodies by checking physiological or behavioral
characteristics, such as fingerprints, voice, dynamic signatures, etc. Biometric
systems are said to be convenient because they need neither something to
memorize such as passwords or something to carry about such as ID cards.
In spite of that, a user of biometric systems would get into a dangerous
situation when her/his biometric data are abused. That is to say, the user
cannot frequently replace or change her/his biometric data to prevent the
abuse because of limits of biometric data intrinsic to her/himself. Therefore,
biometric systems must protect the electronic information for biometrics
against abuse, and also prevent fake biometrics.
</p><p>
We have focused on fingerprint systems since they have become widespread
as authentication terminals for PCs or smart cards or portable terminals.
Some of fingerprint systems may positively utilize artificial fingers as
substitutes in order to solve the problem that a legitimate user cannot access,
for example, when s/he gets injured on her/his fingertip in an
accident.<sup>12</sup> Some other cases include dry fingers, worn fingers,
and other fingers with a low-quality fingerprint. However, the users of those
systems would run a risk because artificial fingers can be stolen and used
by other persons if the systems are utilized for a security application.
Except for the above-mentioned cases, fingerprint systems generally must
reject artificial fingers. In order to reject them, fingerprint systems should
take measures to examine some other features intrinsic to live fingers than
those of fingerprints. These measures are called "live and well detection
<sup>9, 15, 20, 23, 26</sup>" and have been proposed mainly in patent
literature.<sup>13</sup> Although a number of fingerprint systems have come
into wide use, it is not clear whether or not these measures are actually
implemented in commercial fingerprint systems. Moreover, as far as we know,
security evaluation against attacks using fake fingers has been rarely disclosed.
In connection, some researchers reported, in 1998, that four of the six
fingerprint systems with optical devices accepted silicone
fingers.<sup>19</sup> After that, some measures against silicone fingers
may have been taken in fingerprint systems. But, someone might object that
fingerprint systems with capacitive devices can prevent fake fingers, so
they are secure.
</p><p>
Previous to our experiments described in this paper, we made silicone fingers,
and then checked fingerprint systems with them. From the results, we ascertained
that all the systems with a capacitive sensor and some systems with an optical
sensor could reject the silicone fingers. Also, we confirmed that an inked
fingerprint on a paper could be accepted by one of fingerprint systems. A
series of our preliminary experiments brought up a question whether or not
"live and well" functions are actually implemented in commercial fingerprint
systems. Finally, we have carried out experiments with artificial fingers
to inquire into the fact.<sup>9,16,27-29</sup> In this paper we discuss security
evaluation of fingerprint systems, especially for its resistance against
artificial fingers. Here, the term "fake fingers" may be widely used to refer
fingers which are used to deceive fingerprint systems. However, we use the
term "artificial fingers" to refer fingers which are artificially produced
because "fake fingers" may include fingers which are modified from live fingers.
In addition, we use the term "live fingers" to mean fingers which are part
of living bodies.<br>

<b>2. FINGERPRINT SYSTEMS</b>
</p><p>
<b>2.1 Fingerprint Systems</b>
</p><p>
The principle of fingerprint systems is schematically illustrated in <b>Fig.
2.1</b>. In an enrollment process, the system captures finger data from an
enrollee with sensing devices, extracts features from the <i>finger data</i>,
and then record them as template with a personal information, e.g. a personal
identification number (PIN), of the enrollee into a database. We are using
the word "<i>finger data</i>" to mean not only features of the fingerprint
but also other features of the finger, such as "live and well" features.
In an identification (or verification) process, the system captures <i>finger
data </i>from a finger with sensing devices, extracts features, identifies
(or verifies) the features by comparing with templates in the database, and
then outputs a result as "Acceptance" only when the features correspond to
one of the templates.
</p><p align="center">
<img src="gummy_files/fp01.jpg">
</p><p>
Most of fingerprint systems utilize optical or capacitive sensors for capturing
fingerprints.<sup>3, 10, 14, 22</sup> These sensors detect difference between
ridges and valleys of fingerprints. Optical sensors detect difference in
reflection. Capacitive sensors, by contrast, detect difference in capacitance.
Some systems utilize other types of sensors, such as thermal sensors, ultrasound
sensors.<sup>6, 15, 24</sup> In this paper we examine fingerprint systems
which utilize optical or capacitive sensors.
</p><p>
<b>2.2 A Risk Analysis for Fingerprint Systems</b>
</p><p>
Generally, fingerprint systems capture images of fingerprints, extract features
from the images, encrypt the features, transmit them on communication lines,
and then store them as templates into their database. Some systems encrypt
templates with a secure cryptographic scheme and manage not whole original
images but compressed images. Therefore, it is said to be difficult to reproduce
valid fingerprints by using the templates. Some systems are secured against
a so-called replay attack in which an attacker copies a data stream from
a fingerprint scanner to a server and later replays it, with an one time
protocol or a random challenge response device. We are here not concerned
with the security for the communication and database of fingerprint systems,
assuming that they are secure enough by being protected with some encryption
schemes. In this section, we would like to address security of fingerprint
scanners.
</p><p>
When a legitimate user has registered her/his live finger with a fingerprint
system, there would be several ways to deceive the system. In order to deceive
the fingerprint system, an attacker may present the following things to its
fingerprint scanner.
</p><blockquote>
  (1) <b><i>The registered finger:</i></b> The highest risk is being forced
  to press the live finger against the scanner by an armed criminal, or under
  duress. Another risk is being compelled the legitimate user to fall asleep
  with a sleeping drug, in order to make free use of her/his live finger. There
  are some deterrent techniques against these crimes. Combination with another
  authentication method, such as by PINs, passwords, or ID cards, would be
  helpful to deter the crimes.<sup>20</sup> Furthermore, a duress control enables
  the users to alarm "as under duress" with a secret code or manner, which
  is different with a PIN or usual manner respectively. Combining a duress
  control with a fingerprint system would provide a helpful measure to apply
  to someone for protection. Similarly, a two persons control, namely a two
  persons rule, where the authentication process requires two persons properties,
  i.e., fingerprints, or would be helpful to deter the crimes.
  <p>
  (2) <b><i>An unregistered finger (an imposter's finger):</i></b> An attack
  against authentication systems by an imposter with his own biometrics is
  referred to as non-effort forgery.<sup>26</sup> Commonly, accuracy of
  authentication of fingerprint systems are evaluated by the false rejection
  rate (FRR) and the false acceptance rate (FAR).<sup>1, 2</sup> The FAR is
  important indicator for the security against such a method as with an
  unregistered finger. Moreover, fingerprints are usually categorized as "loops,"
  "whorls," "arches," and others. If an attacker knows what category of the
  registered finger is, an unregistered finger of which pattern is similar
  to the registered one would be presented to the scanner. In this case, the
  probability of the acceptance may be different from the ordinary FAR. From
  this point of view, the accuracy of authentication for the system should
  be evaluated not only, as usual, for fingers throughout the categories of
  fingerprints but also for fingers within each category. Another attacker
  may modify his fingerprint by painting, cutting, or injuring his own fingertip.
  However, it is thought to be very difficult to deceive the fingerprint system
  with such a modified finger. The reason for this is that fingerprints are
  so random the attacker cannot identify which patterns should be modified.
  Ordinarily, ten-odd features, such as ridge's and valley's distinctive patterns
  are used for the authentication.
  </p><p>
  (3) <b><i>A severed fingertip from the registered finger:</i></b> A horrible
  attack may be performed with the finger which is severed from the legitimate
  user's hand. Even if the finger severed from the user's half-decomposed corpse,
  the attacker may use, for the wrong purpose, a scientific crime detection
  technique to clarify its fingerprint.<sup>6</sup> In the same way as the
  above-mentioned registered finger, combination with another authentication
  method, or a duress/two-persons control would be helpful to deter these crimes.
  The detection whether the finger is alive or not would be helpful as well.
  </p><p>
  (4) <b><i>A genetic clone of the registered finger:</i></b> In general, it
  is said that identical twins do not have the same fingerprint, and neither
  would clones. The reason is that fingerprints are not entirely genetically
  determined, and rather determined in part by its pattern of nerve growth
  into the skin. As a result, this is not exactly the same even in identical
  twins. However, it is also said that fingerprints are different in identical
  twins, but only slightly different. If the genetic clone's fingerprint is
  similar to the registered finger's, an attacker may try to deceive fingerprint
  systems by using it. Now is the time when we must keep a close watch on such
  possibility with genetic engineering,
  </p><p>
  (5) <b><i>An artificial clone of the registered finger:</i></b> More casual
  attacks against fingerprint systems may use an artificial finger. An artificial
  finger can be produced as a printed fingerprint with a copier or a desk top
  publishing (DTP) technique as well as forged documents. If an attacker can
  make a mold of the registered finger directly modeling it, s/he can produce
  an artificial finger with some materials. Even if not, s/he may make a mold
  of the registered finger modeling its residual fingerprint at second hand,
  so as to produce an artificial finger. And, if an attacker can make an artificial
  finger which can deceive a fingerprint system, one of countermeasures against
  the attack obviously is the detection whether or not the finger is alive.
  Again, combination with another authentication method, or two-persons control
  would be also helpful to deter the crimes.
  </p><p>
  (6) <b><i>The others:</i></b> In some fingerprint systems, an error in
  authentication may be caused by making noise or flashing a light against
  the fingerprint scanner, or by heating up, cooling down, humidifying, impacting
  on, or vibrating the scanner outside its environmental tolerances. Some attackers
  may use the error to deceive the system. This method is well-known as a "fault
  based attack," and may be carried out with above-mentioned attacks. Furthermore,
  a fingerprint image may be stood out in strong relief against the scanner
  surface, if we spray some materials on the surface. The image would be the
  residual fingerprint of a registered finger. In this case, a bald thing or
  finger, regardless of alive or not, which are pressed on the surface, may
  be accepted by the fingerprint system.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As fingerprint systems come into wide use, they are still more exposed themselves
to a risk of casual attacks. Apart from duress or other crimes, our great
concern, in this paper, is the possibilities of attacks with artificial fingers.
</p><p>
<b>2.3 Dishonest Acts with Artiflcial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
In this section, on the assumption that artificial fingers can be accepted
by fingerprint systems, we discuss dishonest acts against the system with
the artificial fingers. Several patterns of dishonest acts, with artificial
fingers, in a fingerprint system are shown in <b>Table 2.1</b>. In this table,
L(X) and L(Y) denote live fingers of persons X and Y respectively. A(X) and
A(Y) denote artificial fingers which are molded after L(X) and L(Y) respectively.
A(Z) denotes artificial fingers which are created artificially without being
molded after live fingers. There may be at the total of 25 possible combinations
because we can enroll and verify each of L(X), L(Y), A(X), A(Y) and A(Z)
in the system. However, we show 15 in 25 combinations and focus on 5
combinations, from (1) to (5), in the table on the following assumptions;

  <li>
    Only X can enroll fingers in the system,
</li></ul>

  <li>
    but X cannot enroll Y's live finger L(Y),
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    the fingers must be enrolled with a genuine X's PIN,
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    and X can obtain and enroll A(Y) and A(Z) in the system.
</li></ul>
<p>
The case (1) is the proper way in the system. The case (2) or (5) is also
the proper way in some systems which positively utilize artificial fingers.
However, we discuss dishonest acts of artificial fingers regarding the cases
from (2) to (5) as dishonest ways. The possible dishonest acts are:<br>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Some other persons than X can pretend, in the system, to be X by presenting
    artificial fingers in all the cases of (2), (4) and (5), and
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Y can pretend, in the system, to be X by presenting her/his own fingers L(Y)
    in the case (3).
</li></ul>
<p>
In addition, X can deny the participation showing by means of evidence that
her/his own live fingers cannot be accepted by the system, when the dishonest
act was detected in the cases (3), (4) and (5).
</p><p>
Most discussion on dishonest acts with artificial fingers have mainly focused
on the case (2). However, it should be noted that the dishonest acts, which
correspond to the cases (4) and (5), can be done if artificial fingers are
accepted by the system. The cases (3), (4) and (5) can be probably prevented
by a practical measure that enrollment is closely watched to prevent using
artificial fingers. Moreover, dishonest acts which correspond to the cases,
from (2) to (5), never occur if the system can successfully reject artificial
fingers.
</p><p>
Accuracy of authentication of fingerprint systems are commonly evaluated
by the false rejection rate (FRR) and the false acceptance rate (FAR).<sup>1,
2</sup> In Table 2.1, the case (1) and the case indicated by the sign '*'
correspond to those which are commonly evaluated by the FRR and FAR in its
ordinary performance test for live finger samples, respectively. It is important
that the acceptance rate for the cases from (2) to (5) should be evaluated
if the system cannot perfectly reject artificial fingers.<br>
</p><p align="center">
<b>3. EXPERIMENTS</b>
</p><p>
<b>3.1 How to make Artificial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
There are several major ways to make an artificial finger of a given live
finger, as shown in <b>Fig. 3.1</b>. First of all, an impression must be
obtained from the live finger. The fingerprint image of the impression is
mostly the lateral reversal, i.e., transposed from left to right as in a
mirror reflection, of the original. This impression may be used as an artificial
finger to deceive the system, if an attacker can make an impression without
being lateral reversal. However, most of the impressions have a lateral reversal
fingerprint image. When a live finger was pressed on an impression material,
a fingerprint image on the impression may be used as a mold of an artificial
finger. If an impression was captured with a digital camera as an electronic
fingerprint image, it may be set right side left by an image processing software,
and then printed on a material to make an artificial finger. This electronic
fingerprint image also can be used to make a mold, as it is. The impression
may be a residual or inked fingerprint. Even if the fingerprint image is
latent, some techniques for scientific crime detection can enhance it with
some material, e.g. aluminum powder, a ninhydrin solution, a cyanoacrylate
adhesive,<sup>6, 18</sup> then producing the artificial finger with them.
Besides these, we can, without original live fingers, create an artificial
finger with a fictitious fingerprint, such as, using a so-called fingerprint
generator.
</p><p>
In our experiments, we make artificial fingers by the following two ways,
which are; ( 1) we make an impression directly pressing a live finger to
plastic material, and then mold an artificial finger with it, and (2) we
wapture an fingerprint image from a residual fingerprint with a digital
microscope, and then make a mold to produce an artificial finger. The material
for artificial fingers is gelatin which is obtained from bone, skin, etc.,
of animals. In this paper we are using the word "<i>gummy</i>" to refer not
a sol but a gel of gelatinous materials. Accordingly, we use the terms
"<i>gummy</i>" fingers to refer artificial fingers which are made of gelatin,
since its toughness are nearly equal to gummies which are one kind of sweets,
and also made of gelatin with some additives such as sugar and/or fruit juice.
Here, the origin of the word "<i>gummy</i>" is "gummi" in the German language.

<b>3.2 Experimental Procedures</b>
</p><p>
The goal of experiments which we conducted is to examine whether fingerprint
systems, which are commercially available, accept the artificial fingers
or not. Accordingly, we examined the acceptance rates of fingerprint systems
by using the artificial fingers, i.e.. <i>gummy</i> fingers, and live fingers.
The following describes procedures of the experiments.
</p><p>
(1) <b><i>Types of artificial fingers:</i></b> Two types of artificial fingers
were examined. One is produced by cloning with a plastic mold. The other
is produced by cloning from a residual fingerprint. These are detailed in
APPENDIX A.
</p><p>
(2) <b><i>Types of experiments:</i></b> Four types of experiments (shown
in Table 3.1) were conducted. Difference in the types are follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <b>Type 1:</b> A subject presents her/his live finger to verify with a template
  which was made by enrolling the live finger.
  <p>
  <b>Type 2:</b> A subject presents her/his live finger to verify with a template
  which was made by enrolling her/his live finger.
  </p><p>
  <b>Type 3:</b> A subject presents her/his live ringer to verify with a template
  which was made by enrolling her/his <i>gummy</i> finger.
  </p><p>
  <b>Type 4:</b> A subject presents her/his <i>gummy</i> finger to verify with
  a template which was rnade by enrolling the artificial finger.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(3) <b><i>Rules in experiments:</i></b> We conducted the experiments under
the extra rules as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  [1] We allowed a tester as deputy for the subject to present or enroll the
  subject's artificial finger.
  <p>
  [2] In Type 4 experiment, we also allowed that an artificial finger which
  is presented is not always the same as one which was used in enrollment.
  </p><p>
  [3] The subject or tester must intentionally present the live/<i>gummy</i>
  finger to fit the center of it to that of a scanning area of the fingerprint
  devise.
  </p><p>
  [4] The <i>gummy</i> fingers can be modified their shape to fit the scanning
  area.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(4) <b><i>The acceptance rates:</i></b> Only one live/<i>gummy</i> finger
must be enrolled as a template while we allowed to retry in enrollment. We
attempted one-to-one verification 100 times in each type of experiment for
each fingerprint system counting the number of times that it accepts a finger
presented. As a result, we measured the acceptance rates in verification
for the fingerprint systems.
</p><p>
(5) <b><i>Subjects:</i></b> The subjects are five persons whose ages are
from 20's to 40's, in the experiment for the <i>gummy</i> fingers cloned
with a plastic mold, whereas the subject is only one person in the experiment
for the <i>gummy</i> fingers cloned from a residual fingerprint.
</p><p>
(6) <b><i>Artificial Fingers:</i></b> <i>Gummy</i> fingers of each subject
were made in the two ways which we explained in APPENDIX A and used in the
experiments.
</p><p>
(7) <b><i>Fingerprint systems:</i></b> We tested  11 types of fingerprint
systems which are shown in <b>APPENDIX B.1</b>. Each of them consists of
a finger device and a software for verification. We set a threshold value
for the highest security level if the fingerprint system allows to adjust
or select threshold values in verification. All of fingerprint devices can
be connected with a personal computer (PC), and used for access control.
The procedures for fingerprint systems are detailed in <b>APPENDIX
B.2</b>.<br>

<b>Figure 4.1</b> shows photomicrographs of a live finger and its artificial
fingers. The <i>gummy</i> finger which is cloned by using a plastic mold
with an impression of the live finger. The molded <i>gummy</i> fingers are
rather transparent and amber while having ridges and valleys similar to those
of the live finger, in terms of the outside appearance. Fingerprint images
of a live finger, a silicone finger and a <i>gummy</i> finger, which were
displayed by the system with Device C (equipped with an optical scanner),
are shown in <b>Fig. 4.2</b>. Here, the silicone finger is the artificial
finger made of silicone rubber, and presented so as to compare with the others.
The captured image of the <i>gummy</i> finger in <b>Fig. 4.2</b> is very
similar to that of the live fingerprint images of a live finger and a
<i>gummy</i> finger, which were displayed by the system with Device H (equipped
with a capacitive sensor), are shown in <b>Fig. 4.3</b>. While some defects
are observed in the image (right side) of a gummy finger, both of the images
are similar to each other. Here, the reason why we do not present the image
of a silicone finger is that it cannot be accepted by the system with Device
H.

<b>4.1.2 Acceptance Rates of the Artificial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
The results of the experiments for the artificial fingers, which were cloned
with molds, are shown in <b>Fig 4.4</b>. It was found through the experiments
that we could enroll the <i>gummy</i> fingers in all of the 11 types of
fingerprint systems. It was also found that all of the fingerprint systems
accepted the <i>gummy</i> fingers in their verification procedures with the
probability of 68-100%.

<b>4.2 Cloning from a Residual Fingerprint</b>
</p><p>
<b>4.2.1 Artificial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
<b>Figure 4.5</b> (a) shows the outside appearance of the mold which we used
in our experiments. <b>Figure 4.5</b> (b) shows a photograph of the gummy
finger which was produced from a residual fingerprint on a glass plate, enhancing
it with a cyanoacrylate adhesive. We applied a technique for processing printed
circuit boards to the production of the molds for cloning the gummy fingers.
The fingerprint image of the <i>gummy</i> finger, which was displayed by
the system with Device H (equipped with a capacitive sensor), is shown in
<b>Fig. 4.6</b>.

</p><p>
<b>4.2.2. Acceptance Rates of the Artificial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
The results of the experiments for an artificial finger, which was cloned
from a residual fingerprint, are shown in <b>Fig. 4.7</b>. As a result, we
could enroll the <i>gummy</i> finger in all of the 11 types of fingerprint
systems. It was found that all of the fingerprint systems accepted the
<b>gummy</b> finger in their verification procedures with the probability
of more than 67%.
</p><p>
<b>4.3 Discussions</b>
</p><p>
The number of samples in the experiments is so small that we cannot compare
performance of the fingerprint systems. However, the number of samples is
enough for us to see evidence that the <i>gummy</i> fingers could be accepted
by commercial fingerprint systems. Based on our analysis, these variations
may be caused by deformation of <i>gummy</i> fingers. We found that some
of artificial fingers were damaged while being heated by the fingerprint
sensors in the experiments. Some of the sensors frequently heated up when
repeating verification in a short period. We think that the number of acceptance
will increase if we pause for cooling every time after verification. We
mentioned, in section 3.2, that the <i>gummy</i> fingers can be modified
their shape to fit the scanning area. Accordingly, we cut the <i>gummy</i>
fingers to fit the sensing area for some devices. This might cause decrease
of errors in positioning the <i>gummy</i> fingers. Another reason why the
number of acceptance varies is that we allowed retrying in enrollment. Finally,
all of <i>gummy</i> fingers could be enrolled in the end in our experiments,
even if the systems employ some protection. Also, the number of acceptance
of live fingers is greater than that of <i>gummy</i> fingers for some systems
that may employ so-called live and well detection.
</p><p>
We have investigated the difference in characteristics of live, <i>gummy</i>
and silicone fingers. While silicone fingers were impossible to measure,
the moisture and electric resistance of the gummy fingers could be measured
as shown in <b>Table 4.1</b>. We used a moisture meter, and a digital multimeter
(range: from 0 to 40 Mohms). According to this comparison, <i>gummy</i> fingers
are more similar to live fingers in their characteristics than silicone fingers.
The compliance was also examined for live and <i>gummy</i> fingers as shown
in <b>Fig. 4.8</b>. Here, the compliance indicated by the change in resonance
frequency (i.e., tactile sensor output) as the function of the pressure (i.e.,
pressure sensor output). In brief, Fig. 4.8 shows that the live finger is
softer than the <i>gummy</i> finger. We found that these fingers are clearly
different in compliance.<sup>8</sup>
</p><p align="center">
<img src="gummy_files/fp04.jpg">
</p><p>
If "live and well" detectors can clearly distinguish their moisture, electric
resistance, transparency or bubble content (i.e., bubble rich material or
not) between live fingers and <i>gummy</i> fingers, fingerprint systems can
reject <i>gummy </i>fingers. Also, detection of compliance would be helpful
for preventing <i>gummy</i> fingers. Furthermore, some of measures which
have been proposed in patent literature may be useful in preventing
<i>gummy</i> fingers.<br>
</p><p align="center">
<b>5. CONCLUSIONS</b>
</p><p>
In this paper, we illustrated a risk analysis for fingerprint systems. The
risk analysis revealed that there are many attack ways to deceive the systems,
even if their templates and communication are protected by a secure measure.
Conventional arguments tend to focus on a question how to detect use of
artificial fingers, which derive from live fingers of legitimate users. However,
as we pointed out, there can be various dishonest acts using artificial fingers
against the systems. We also pointed out that artificial fingers can be made
not only of silicone but also of gelatin, and examined 11 types of fingerprint
systems whether or not they accept the <i>gummy</i> fingers. Consequently,
all of these systems accepted the <i>gummy</i> fingers all in their enrollment
procedures and also with the rather higher probability in theirverification
procedures. The results are enough for us to see evidence that artificial
fingers can be accepted by commercial fingerprint systems. The objection
will no doubt be raised that it is very difficult to take an impression of
the live finger from a legitimate user without the cooperation of her/him.
Therefore, we demonstrated that the <i>gummy</i> fingers made from residual
fingerprints can be accepted by all of the 11 systems.
</p><p>
After we started this study, we come to know by the published book, that
Dutch researchers reported that an artificial finger, which was made of silicone
rubber, putting saliva on its surface can be accepted by fingerprint systems
with capacitive devices. Their
<a href="http://cryptome.org/fake-prints.htm">study</a> and ours share certain
similarities in that both intend to encourage the suppliers and users of
fingerprint systems to reconsider security of their systems. While their
study is seen to be of use in designing fingerprint systems, unfortunately,
details of the experimental conditions have not been described.
</p><p>
As we mentioned, a user of biometric systems cannot frequently replace or
change her/his biometric data because of limits of biometric data intrinsic
to her/himself. For example, gelatin, i.e., an ingredient of gummies, and
soft plastic materials are easy to obtain at grocery stores and hobby shops,
respectively. The fact that <i>gummy</i> fingers, which are easy to make
with cheap, easily obtainable tools and materials, can be accepted suggests
review not only of fingerprint systems but also of biometric systems.
Manufacturers and vendors of biometric systems should carefully examine the
security of their systems against artificial clones. Also, they should make
public results of their examination, which lead users of their system to
a deeper understanding of the security. The experimental study on the
<i>gummy</i> fingers will have considerable impact on security assessment
of fingerprint systems.
</p><p>
<b><i>Declaration:</i></b> We would like to stress that this study intends
to encourage the suppliers and users of fingerprint systems to reconsider
security of their systems, not to criticize libelously fingerprint systems
for their security, and not to compare their performance.<sup>17</sup> For
this purpose, we have collected, for our experiments, as many fingerprint
systems commercially vailable as we could, and have detailed their specification
and the experimental conditions.<br>

<b>APPENDIX A</b>
</p><p>
<b>A. Recipes for Artificial Fingers</b>
</p><p>
<b>A.1 Making an Artificial Finger Directly from a Live
Finger</b><sup>27-29</sup>
</p><p>
<b>+ Ingredients </b><br>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Material for molds:</i></b> "FREEPLASTIC"<br>
    <br>
    Free molding plastic is used for plastic models and can be bought at hobby
    shops. The cost of the material is around 300 yen per 35 grams. Here,
    "FREEPLASTIC" is a registered trademark of Daicel FineChem Ltd. (formerly
    Dalcel Craft Ltd.). Also, silicone rubber can be alternatively used for the
    impression material.
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Material for artificial fingers:</i></b> "GELATINE LEAF"<br>
    <br>
    Solid gelatin sheet is used for ingredients for confectionery such gel foods
    as jellied meats. soups, and candies and molded desserts, and also can be
    bought at grocery stores. The cost of the material is around 200 yen per
    30 grams. Here, "GELATINE LEAF" is a product of MARUHA CORP. Gelatin powder
    can be used altematively for solid gelatin sheet, and however is a little
    hard to treat.
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>+ How to make a mold</b>
</p><p>
We make molds, which are made of free molding plastic, of live fingers, and
then make artificial fingers, which are made of gelatin, with the molds.
</p><p>
We make molds by the following procedures.
</p><blockquote>
  (1) Put the material "FREEPLASTIC" into hot water, which temperature is more
  than around 60 degrees Centigrade, to soften it, and then take it out.
  <p>
  (2) Wait until the plastic will get a little cool, and then make it round
  as a small ball.
  </p><p>
  (3) Press against the plastic ball so as to make the fingertip be in the
  same condition as it was scanned by fingerprint devices.
  </p><p>
  (4) Wait till the plastic hardens. And then, remove the fingertip from the
  mold. It takes around ten minutes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ How to make artificial fingers</b>
</p><p>
We make artificial fingers by the following procedures.
</p><blockquote>
  (1) Add boiling water (30cc) to solid gelatin (30 grams) in a bottle and
  mix up them. Cap the bottle and wait till the mixture forms a gel as it cools,
  and then melt to form a sol by heating with a microwave oven. After that,
  cool down to form a gel and heat up to form a sol several times to reduce
  bubbles, if necessary. As a result of this procedure, a liquid in which immersed
  gelatin at 50 wt.% (a sol) will be obtained.
  <p>
  (2) Prepare a mold, and pour the liquid into the mold. Remove carefully bubbles
  which are formed around the base of the mold, if necessary.
  </p><p>
  (3) Put this mold into a refrigerator to cool, and wait for about ten minutes
  till the liquid changes back to a gel. Pull the gel (i.e., artificial finger)
  out of the mold.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Repeat (2) and (3) to make the <i>gummy</i> fingers.
</p><p>
<b>A.2 Making an Artificial Finger from a Residual
Fingerprint</b><sup>9</sup>
</p><p>
<b>+ Ingredients</b><br>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Material for molds:</i></b> photosensitive coated PCBs "10K"<br>
    <br>
    You can find a photo sensitive coated printed circuit board (PCB) ready to
    use in most electronics shops, or hobby shops. The cost of the PCB is around
    320 yen per sheet. Here, "10K" is a product of Sanhavato Co., Ltd. The other
    materials necessary for processing will be given in the followings.
</li></ul>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>+ How to make a mold</b>
</p><p>
We make molds, which are made by photolithographic processes, of live fingers,
and then make artificial fingers, which are made of gelatin, with the molds.
</p><p>
We make molds by the following procedures.<br>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Making a mask</i></b><br>
    <br>
    (1) Press the live finger against a glass plate so as to make its residual
    fingerprint.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Enhance this latent fingerprint with a cyanoacrylate adhesive. If you
    put the adhesive with the glass plate intolairtight container, it will keep
    for quite a long time. Wait for a minute. The fingerprint will stand clearly
    outlined against the glass plate.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Capture an image of the fingerprint with a digital microscopic camera
    (e.g., KEYENCE; VH-6300, 900k pixels). Set the fingerprint image right side
    left, and make its contrast better with an image processing software (e.g.,
    Adobe; Photoshop 6.0).<br>
    <br>
    (4) Print the fingerprint image in a transparency sheet with an inkjet printer
    (e.g., Canon; BJ-F800, 1200x600dpi). It can be used for a mask.<br>
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Making a mold</i></b><br>
    <br>
    (1) Prepare a photo sensitive coated PCB, and fix the mask so that its printed
    surface is attached on the PCB. Exose an UV light source for 6 minutes to
    copy the mask to the photo resist layer of the PCB. Caution: The UV light
    are harmful for your eyes and you shouldn't look it many time, or any at
    all.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Develop the PCB to remove all the unnecessary photo resist, and expose
    the unnecessary copper.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Etch the developed PCB to remove all the unnecessary copper, and get
    only the fingerprint. Finally, the mold for artificial fingers can be
    obtained.<br>
</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>Making an artiflicial finger</i></b><br>
    <br>
    We make artificial fingers by the following procedures.<br>
    <br>
    (1) Add boiling water (30cc) to solid gelatin (24 grams) in a bottle and
    mix up them. Cap the bottle and wait till mixture forms a gel as it cools,
    and then melt to form a sol by heating with a microwave oven. After that,
    cool down to form a gel and heat up to form a sol several times to reduce
    bubbles, if necessary. As a result of this procedure, a liquid in which immersed
    gelatin at around 40 wt.% (a sol) will be obtained.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Prepare a mold, and drip the liquid onto the mold. Remove carefully bubbles
    which are formed around the base of the mold, if necessary.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Put this mold into a refrigerator to cool, and wait for about ten minutes
    till the liquid changes back to a gel. Peel carefully the gel (i.e., artificial
    finger) from the mold.<br>
    <br>
    Repeat (2) and (3) to make the <i>gummy</i> fingers.

<b>B.2 The Procedures for the Fingerprint Systems</b>
</p><p>
The followings give the procedures for each fingerprint device.
</p><p>
<b>Device A:</b> We enroll a finger as a template in the system. And then,
enrollment will be finished if the template can be verified in a subsequent
verification. We used a logon sequence, which is a function of the system,
to know whether the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint images
are displayed on the screen of the PC both in enrollment an in verification.
</p><p>
<b>Device B:</b> We enroll a finger four times in the system to make a template.
We can check whether the template in good condition by activating a verification
function. We used this function to know whether the system accepts the finger
or not Fingerprint images are not displayed on the screen ofthe PC.
</p><p>
<b>Device C:</b> We enroll a finger three times in the system to make a template.
And then, we exit the application of the fingerprint system. We can encounter
a verification procedure when we start the application again. We used this
procedure to know whether the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint
images are displayed on the screen of the PC only in enrollment.
</p><p>
<b>Device D:</b> We enroll a finger four times in the system to make a template.
We used a logon sequence, which is a function of the system, to know whether
the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint images are displayed on
the screen of the PC only in enrollment.
</p><p>
<b>Device E:</b> We enroll a finger as a template in the system. We can check
whether the template is in good condition by activating a verification function.
We used this function to know whether the system accepts the finger or not.
Fingerprint images are displayed on the screen of the PC both in enrollment
and in verification.
</p><p>
<b>Device F:</b> We enroll a finger four times in the system to make a template.
We used a logon sequence, which is a function of the system, to know whether
the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint images are displayed on
the screen of the PC only in enrollment.
</p><p>
<b>Device G:</b> The system is the same as that of Device C.
</p><p>
<b>Device H:</b> We enroll a finger three times in the system to make a template.
We can check whether the template is in good condition by activating a
verification function. We used this function to know whether the system accepts
the finger or not. Fingerprint images are displayed on the screen of the
PC both in enrollment and in verification.
</p><p>
<b>Device I:</b> We enroll a finger four times in the system to make a template.
We can check whether the template is in good condition by activating a
verification function. We used this function to know whether the system accepts
the finger or not. Fingerprint images are displayed on the screen of the
PC only in enrollment.
</p><p>
<b>Device J:</b> We enroll a finger two times in the system to make a template.
We used a logon sequence, which is a function of the system, to know whether
the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint images are displayed on
the screen f the PC only in enrollment.
</p><p>
<b>Device K:</b> We enroll a finger three times in the system to make a template.
We used a logon sequence entering the user's ID, activating a verification
function, to know whether the system accepts the finger or not. Fingerprint
images are displayed on the screen of the PC only in enrollment, but not
in verification.

  Fun with Fingerprint Readers
</h3>
<p>
Tsutomu Matsumoto, a Japanese cryptographer, recently decided to look at
biometric fingerprint devices.  These are security systems that attempt
to identify people based on their fingerprint.  For years the companies
selling these devices have claimed that they are very secure, and that it
is almost impossible to fool them into accepting a fake finger as genuine. 
Matsumoto, along with his students at the Yokohama National University, showed
that they can be reliably fooled with a little ingenuity and $10 worth of
household supplies.
</p><p>
Matsumoto uses gelatin, the stuff that Gummi Bears are made out of. 
First he takes a live finger and makes a plastic mold.  (He uses a
free-molding plastic used to make plastic molds, and is sold at hobby
shops.)  Then he pours liquid gelatin into the mold and lets it
harden.  (The gelatin comes in solid sheets, and is used to make jellied
meats, soups, and candies, and is sold in grocery stores.)  This gelatin
fake finger fools fingerprint detectors about 80% of the time.
</p><p>
His more interesting experiment involves latent fingerprints.  He takes
a fingerprint left on a piece of glass, enhances it with a cyanoacrylate
adhesive, and then photographs it with a digital camera.  Using PhotoShop,
he improves the contrast and prints the fingerprint onto a transparency
sheet.  Then, he takes a photo-sensitive printed-circuit board (PCB)
and uses the fingerprint transparency to etch the fingerprint into the copper,
making it three-dimensional.  (You can find photo-sensitive PCBs, along
with instructions for use, in most electronics hobby shops.)  Finally,
he makes a gelatin finger using the print on the PCB.  This also fools
fingerprint detectors about 80% of the time.
</p><p>
Gummy fingers can even fool sensors being watched by guards.  Simply
form the clear gelatin finger over your own.  This lets you hide it
as you press your own finger onto the sensor.  After it lets you in,
eat the evidence.
</p><p>
Matsumoto tried these attacks against eleven commercially available fingerprint
biometric systems, and was able to reliably fool all of them.  The results
are enough to scrap the systems completely, and to send the various fingerprint
biometric companies packing.  Impressive is an understatement.
</p><p>
There's both a specific and a general moral to take away from this result. 
Matsumoto is not a professional fake-finger scientist; he's a
mathematician.  He didn't use expensive equipment or a specialized
laboratory.  He used $10 of ingredients you could buy, and whipped up
his gummy fingers in the equivalent of a home kitchen.  And he defeated
eleven different commercial fingerprint readers, with both optical and capacitive
sensors, and some with "live finger detection" features.  (Moistening
the gummy finger helps defeat sensors that measure moisture or electrical
resistance; it takes some practice to get it right.)  If he could do
this, then any semi-professional can almost certainly do much much more.
</p><p>
More generally, be very careful before believing claims from security
companies.  All the fingerprint companies have claimed for years that
this kind of thing is impossible.  When they read Matsumoto's results,
they're going to claim that they don't really work, or that they don't apply
to them, or that they've fixed the problem.  Think twice before believing
them.
