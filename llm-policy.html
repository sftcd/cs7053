<h1 id="guidelinesonuseofexternalaitoolsforwrittenassignments">Guidelines on Use of External AI Tools for Written Assignments</h1>

<p>Dear students,</p>

<p>As you embark on your written assignments for the CS7NS5/CSU44032, I would like to clarify the module's policy on using external tools, particularly AI-driven tools like ChatGPT or similar:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Personal Effort &amp; Authenticity: I encourage you to complete assignments using your own thoughts, understanding, and research. This not only upholds the academic integrity of the assignment but also ensures you get the most out of this learning experience. As such, I'd prefer you avoid relying on ChatGPT or other similar tools to generate content for your assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Transparency Requirement: If, for any reason, you choose to use ChatGPT or any similar AI tool for a portion of your assignment, it's mandatory that you disclose this. Please include an appendix in your submission detailing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which sections or parts of the assignment were generated or influenced by the tool.</li>
<li>A brief explanation of why you chose to use the tool for that portion.</li>
<li>Any specific prompts or questions you posed to the tool, and its responses.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Your transparency in this matter will be appreciated and taken into account during grading. Failure to disclose such use, if detected, may have implications for your assignment grade.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding and commitment to authentic learning. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.</p>

<p><b>Appendix</b>:
This text was generated by GPT using the prompt below, which was a question asked by Stephen Farrell. As nobody had text already, Vasileios Koutavas had the fine (and nicely ironic:-) idea of asking ChatGPT to produce some text.</p>

<p><code>
I'd like to have a bit of text to send to students doing written
assignments for my module that more or less says: "a) I'd
prefer you didn't use chatgpt or similar, b) if you did, then add an appendix
that says what you did, including &lt;details&gt;" - has anyone got such a bit of
text?
</code></p>
